## Introduction

Comment Bot Demo - https://streamable.com/j5di2m

Welcome to BetterSol, a webapp that allows you to launch tokens and manage wallets using a straightforward UI. Scripts/Bots are useful, but when you run into problems it may be difficult to resolve them yourself if you are not a developer. BetterSol seeks to alleviate this problem by bringing you all the same functionality in the form of a clean UI.
